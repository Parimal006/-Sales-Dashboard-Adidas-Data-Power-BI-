# -Sales-Dashboard-Adidas-Data-Power-BI-
This is a simple yet powerful sales dashboard I created using Power BI and Adidas sales data. It highlights key insights like total revenue, profits, top-performing regions, and product categories—all in one interactive view. With filters, maps, and trend analysis, it’s designed to make data easy to explore and understand.
